            <p>Hey, this is my homepage, so I have to say something about myself. Sometimes it is hard to introduce
                yourself because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with. Let me give a try
                to see what kind of image you have about me through my self-description. I hope that my impression about
                myself and your impression about me are not so different. Here it goes</p>

            <h3>Liking everything is My Hobby</h3>
            <p>I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and
                to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like
                to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to
                feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the
                clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle
                of the night. I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. I like to
                sleep early, I like to get up late; I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people. I like
                countrys peace,I like delicious foods and comfortable shoes; I like horror movies. I
                like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.</p>
